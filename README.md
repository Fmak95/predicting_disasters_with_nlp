# Predicting Disasters with NLP
A text classification model that uses twitter data to determine if a tweet is about a real disaster or not. The dataset can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started">here.</a>

## Introduction
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. With smartphones, people are able to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

## Methodology
In this work, I utilize some of the state-of-the-art transformer models, specifically the BERT model and the Universal Sentence Encoder model. After fine-tuning of the models, I seek to gain more understanding of the models by using model interpretation techniques to understand these black-box models.
